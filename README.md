# RPi_FlaskDevelopment

This repository is dedicated to the development of relay_flaskapp. 

The relay_flaskapp cannot be run locally on pc because it uses the RPi GPIO library.
All GPIO commands will be removed. Templates will be added for HTML interface and Flask-
Ask will be imported for Alexa Skill development.
